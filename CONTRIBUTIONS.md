# Contributions

You can contribute anyway you like. some ideas,

- Update documents
- Better demo site
- Submit new style
- Better naming convention for link styles
- Imporve performance
- Something else?

Follow this checklist before submiting any PR(I myself follow this to avoid unnecessary commits and amends).

- Describe the message properly in the commit. If it's related to any issue then mention it.
- Update documents whenever required (README.md, STYLES.md, and CONTRIBUTIONS.md).
